        ##  5 times professionalism. 5 times wishes. 5 times Ruby.
        ### About Us
        We are a group of Ruby lovers in Taiwan. Our lives are closed bounded with Ruby/Rails.

        Ruby on Rails saves time on development, and has been favored by many foreign enterprises and start-ups. The simpolicity and elegance of Ruby language brings a lot of fun to the engineers too. However, in Taiwan, on a few enterprises are using Ruby/Rails as their main developping tool.

        Over the years we have continuously provided courses to universities in Taiwan (NCKU, Fujen University, TTCB), teaching Ruby and Rails. From our obesevation of students reactions, we noticed that most students find Ruby not so difficult to learn. They could achieve certain level by studying textbooks and practicing via documents from the official website. However, self-study cannot cover all aspects if they wish to elevate into the next level or start working on business projects. They need more authentic practiese and the guidance of lecturers. This is why senior or experienced Ruby/Rails developpes are not easy to be found in Taiwan.

        We have also interviewed some enterprises and came to understand the reason why they don't use Ruby/ Raisl. Most of it comes from the shortage of Ruby/Rails engineers, and that technical support is scarce too. They didn't know who to ask for help if a problem occurs. 

        In the recent one or two years, the demand of Ruby/Rails expertise grew, more and more high-paid vancies were released, encrouaging more and more people to enter the world of Ruby/Rails. Many people have, besides self-learning, participated in the sharing and exchanges of activities organized by Ruby communities. 

        "If there were only faster and more efficient way to enhance my level." Voices like this started to reveal. 

        Therefore, a group of Ruby lovers started dicussing, "Maybe we can establish a company to provide technical consultancy or training related to Ruby/Rails."

        Our ultumate goal is for more and more enterprises in Taiwan to know more about this elegant, fun and very productive programming language and start using it as their main development tool to speed up their dreams. 

        As to why the company name is 5 times and not 3 or 100 times? Well, that's another story.
